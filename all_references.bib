	abstract = {During the past decade dramatic progress has been made in calculating the binding energies of molecules. This is the result of two advances reported in 1989:  an accurate method for solving the electronic Schrödinger equation that is applicable to a broad range of moleculesthe CCSD(T) methodand families of basis sets that systematically converge to the complete basis set limitthe correlation consistent basis sets. The former provides unprecedented accuracy for the prediction of a broad range of molecular properties, including molecular binding energies. The latter provides a means to systematically approach the complete basis set limit, i.e., the exact solutions of approximations to the Schrödinger equation. These two advances combined with a thorough analysis of the errors involved in electronic structure calculations lead to clear guidelines for ab initio calculations of binding energies, ranging from the strong bonds derived from chemical interactions to the extremely weak binding due to dispersion interactions. This analysis has also led to surprises, e.g., it has shown that the Møller−Plesset perturbation theory is unsuitable for calculation of bond energies to chemical accuracy, i.e., with errors of less that 1 kcal/mol. This applies whether one is interested in absolute bond energies or relative bond energies. Although the analysis presented here is focused on the calculation of molecular binding energies, this same approach can be readily extended to other molecular properties.},

	abstract = {We present an empirical flexible and polarizable water model which gives an improved description of the position, momentum, and dynamical (spectroscopic) distributions of H nuclei in water. We use path integral molecular dynamics techniques in order to obtain momentum and position distributions and an approximate solution to the Schrödinger equation to obtain the infrared (IR) spectrum. We show that when the calculated distributions are compared to experiment the existing empirical models tend to overestimate the stiffness of the H nuclei involved in H bonds. Also, these models vastly underestimate the enormous increase in the integrated IR intensity observed in the bulk over the gas-phase value. We demonstrate that the over-rigidity of the OH stretch and the underestimation of intensity are connected to the failure of existing models to reproduce the correct monomer polarizability surface. A new model, TTM4-F, is parametrized against electronic structure results in order to better reproduce the polarizability surface. It is found that TTM4-F gives a superior description of the observed spectroscopy, showing both the correct redshift and a much improved intensity. TTM4-F also has a somewhat improved dielectric constant and OH distribution function. It also gives an improved match to the experimental momentum distribution, although some discrepancies remain.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in path integral methodology have significantly reduced the computational expense of including quantum mechanical effects in the nuclear motion in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. However, the implementation of these developments requires a considerable programming effort, which has hindered their adoption. Here we describe i-PI, an interface written in Python that has been designed to minimise the effort required to bring state-of-the-art path integral techniques to an electronic structure program. While it is best suited to first principles calculations and path integral molecular dynamics, i-PI can also be used to perform classical molecular dynamics simulations, and can just as easily be interfaced with an empirical forcefield code. To give just one example of the many potential applications of the interface, we use it in conjunction with the CP2K electronic structure package to showcase the importance of nuclear quantum effects in high-pressure water.

The two terms are strongly correlated with each other for the hydrogen-bonded pairs. The strength of the hydrogen bonds in the clusters is further classified by the types of the hydrogen donor and acceptor water molecules. The relative energies evaluated with the LPMO PT among the isomers of (H2O)6, (H2O)11, and (H2O)16 agree very well with those obtained from CCSD(T) calculations with large basis sets.

The onset of the appearance of the first “interior” configuration in water clusters occurs for n=17. The observed structural alternation between interior (n=17, 19, 21) and all-surface (n=18, 20) global minima in the n=17–21 cluster regime is accompanied by a corresponding spectroscopic signature, namely, the undulation in the position of the most redshifted OH stretching vibrations according to the trend: interior configurations exhibit more redshifted OH stretching vibrations than all-surface ones. These most redshifted OH stretching vibrations form distinct groups in the intramolecular region of the spectra and correspond to localized vibrations of donor OH stretches that are connected to neighbors via “strong” (water dimer-like) hydrogen bonds and belong to a water molecule with a “free” OH stretch.},

Linear and nonlinear infrared (IR) spectra are calculated for liquid water, HOD in D2O and HOD in H2O, and discussed in the context of the results obtained using other approaches that have been employed in studies of water dynamics. A comparison between the calculated spectra and the available experimental data yields an overall good agreement, indicating the accuracy of the present simulation approach in describing the properties of liquid water under ambient conditions.

The energy separation between the ‘cyclic’ and ‘open’ water trimer minima was estimated at 4·2 kcal mot −1. Its origin was quantitatively accounted for in terms of the difference between the two- and three-body energy terms for the two configurations. We have found that the three-body term is attractive and accounts for 18\% of the binding energy of the ‘cyclic’ trimer but its contribution is less significant (6\%) and repulsive for the ‘open’ trimer. It is also repulsive but smaller (4\%) for an intermediate trimer configuration which has the arrangement double acceptor, double donor, donor-acceptor for the three water molecules. Many-body energy terms higher than two are, however, less significant for configurations resembling bulk water which have, on the average, two hydrogen bonds per water molecule.

This approach which we have termed “plug and play” is extended here to improve the precision of the 2-body fit in the long range. This is done by combining two separate fits. One is a fit to 47 593 2-body energies in the region of strong interaction and approaching the long range, and the second one is a fit to 6244 2-body energies in the long range. The two fits have a region of overlap which permits a smooth switch from one to the other. All energies are obtained at the CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Properties of the full PES, i.e., stationary points, harmonic frequencies of the global minimum, etc., are shown to be in excellent agreement with direct CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ results. Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the dimer zero-point energy (ZPE) are performed, and a dissociation energy, D0, of 787 cm−1 is obtained using that ZPE, De, and the rigorous ZPEs of the monomers. Using a benchmark De, D0 is 758 cm−1. Vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF)/virtual state configuration interaction (VCI) MULTIMODE calculations of intramolecular fundamentals are reported and are in good agreement with available experimental results.

Two approaches, each able to ensure the asymptotic zero-interaction limit of intrinsic potentials, are presented. They are both based on the tailored selection of a subset of the polynomials of the original basis. A computationally efficient approach exploits reduced permutational invariance and provides a compact fitting basis dependent only on intermolecular distances. We apply the original and new techniques to obtain a number of full-dimensional potentials for the intrinsic three-body methane–water–water interaction by fitting a database made of 22,592 ab initio energies calculated at the MP2-F12 level of theory with haTZ (aug-cc-pVTZ for C and O, cc-pVTZ for H) basis set. An investigation of the effects of permutational symmetry on fitting accuracy and computational costs is reported. Several of the fitted potentials are then employed to evaluate with high accuracy the three-body contribution to the CH4–H2O–H2O binding energy and the three-body energy of three conformers of the CH4@(H2O)20 cluster.},

This approach is based on our previously proposed GMFCC/MM method (He; et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 124, 184703), In this EE-GMFCC scheme, the total energy of protein is calculated by taking a linear combination of the QM energy of the neighboring residues and the two-body QM interaction energy between non-neighboring residues that are spatially in close contact. All the fragment calculations are embedded in a field of point charges representing the remaining protein environment, which is the major improvement over our previous GMFCC/MM approach. Numerical studies are carried out to calculate the total energies of 18 real three-dimensional proteins of up to 1142 atoms using the EE-GMFCC approach at the HF/6-31G* level. The overall mean unsigned error of EE-GMFCC for the 18 proteins is 2.39 kcal/mol with reference to the full system HF/6-31G* energies. The EE-GMFCC approach is also applied for proteins at the levels of the density functional theory (DFT) and second-order many-body perturbation theory (MP2), also showing only a few kcal/mol deviation from the corresponding full system result. The EE-GMFCC method is linear-scaling with a low prefactor, trivially parallel, and can be readily applied to routinely perform structural optimization of proteins and molecular dynamics simulation with high level ab initio electronic structure theories.},

In this study, we utilized electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation (EE-GMF) method for full QM calculation of the large-sized ion–water clusters (up to 15 Na+ and 15 Cl– ions solvated with 119 water molecules). Through systematic validation using different fragment sizes, we show that, by using distance thresholds of 6 Å for both the two-body and three-body QM interactions, the EE-GMF method is capable of providing accurate ground-state energies of large-sized ion–water clusters at different ab initio levels (including HF, B3LYP, M06-2X, and MP2) with significantly reduced computational cost. The deviations of EE-GMF from full system calculations are within a few kcal/mol. The result clearly shows that the calculated energies of the ion–water clusters using EE-GMF are close to converge after the distance thresholds are larger than 6 Å for both the two-body and three-body QM interactions. This study underscores the importance of the three-body interactions in ion–water clusters. The EE-GMF method can also accurately reproduce the relative energy profiles of the ion–water clusters.},

The method employs energy gradients extracted from fragment wave functions, enabling computations otherwise impractical on PC hardware.

	abstract = {ConspectusChemistry on the scale of molecular clusters may be dramatically different from that in the macroscopic bulk. Greater understanding of chemistry in this size regime could greatly influence fields such as materials science and atmospheric and environmental chemistry. Recent advances in experimental techniques and computational resources have led to accurate investigations of the energies and spectral properties of weakly bonded molecular clusters. These have enabled researchers to learn how the physicochemical properties evolve from individual molecules to bulk materials and to understand the growth patterns of clusters.Experimental techniques such as infrared, microwave, and photoelectron spectroscopy are the most popular and powerful tools for probing molecular clusters. In general, these experimental techniques do not directly reveal the atomistic details of the clusters but provide data from which the structural details need to be unearthed. Furthermore, the resolution of the spectral properties of energetically close cluster conformers can be prohibitively difficult. Thus, these investigations of molecular aggregates require a combination of experiments and theory. On the theoretical front, researchers have been actively engaged in quantum chemical ab initio calculations as well as simulation-based studies for the last few decades. To obtain reliable results, there is a need to use correlated methods such as Møller–Plesset second order method, coupled cluster theory, or dispersion corrected density functional theory. However, due to nonlinear scaling of these methods, optimizing the geometry of large clusters still remains a formidable quantum chemistry challenge.Fragment-based methods, such as divide-and-conquer, molecular tailoring approach (MTA), fragment molecular orbitals, and generalized energy-based fragmentation approach, provide alternatives for overcoming the scaling problem for spatially extended molecular systems. Within MTA, a large system is broken down into two or more subsystems that can be readily treated computationally. Finally, the properties of the large system are obtained by patching the corresponding properties of all the subsystems. Due to these approximations, the resulting MTA-based energies carry some error in comparison with calculations based on the full system. An approach for correcting these errors has been attempted by grafting the error at a lower basis set onto a higher basis set. Furthermore, investigating the growth patterns and nucleation processes in clusters is necessary for understanding the structural transitions and the phenomena of magic numbers in cluster chemistry. Therefore, systematic building-up or the introduction of stochastics for generating molecular assemblies is the most crucial step for studying large clusters.In this Account, we discuss the working principle of MTA for probing molecular clusters at ab initio level followed by a brief summary of an automated and electrostatics-guided algorithm for building molecular assemblies. The molecular aggregates presented here as test cases are generated based on either an electrostatic criterion or the basin hopping method. At MP2 level computation, the errors in MTA-based grafted energies are typically reduced to a submillihartree level, reflecting the potential of finding accurate energies of molecular clusters much more quickly. In summary, MTA provides a platform for effectively studying large molecular clusters at ab initio level of theory using minimal computer hardware.},

	abstract = {A method for calculations of the ground-state energy and structure of finite systems and for molecular-dynamics simulations of the evolution of the nuclei on the Born-Oppenheimer ground-state electronic potential-energy surface is described. The method is based on local-spin-density functional theory, using nonlocal pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. Evaluations of Hamiltonian matrix elements and the operations on the wave functions are performed using a dual-space representation. The method, which does not involve a supercell, affords accurate efficient simulations of neutral or charged finite systems which possess, or may develop, multipole moments. Since the ground-state electronic energy and the forces on the ions are calculated for each nuclear configuration during a dynammical simulation, a relatively large time step can be used to integrate the classical equations of motion of the nuclei (1–10 fs, depending on the characteristic frequencies of the ionic degrees of freedom). The method is demonstrated via a study of the energetics, structure, and dynamics of the water dimer, (H2O)2, yielding results in agreement with experimental data and other theoretical calculations. In addition to the properties of the ground state of the dimer, higher-energy transition structures involved in transformations between equivalent structures of the (H2O)2 molecule, were studied, and finite temperature simulations of the dynamics of such transformations are presented.},

Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic, and thermodynamic quantities in these systems are reviewed here. The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is also discussed. This review additionally considers the theoretical foundations of the method, examining its relationship to matrix-product states and the quantum information content of the density matrices generated by the DMRG.},

	abstract = {Macromolecular structures, such as neuraminidases, hemagglutinins, and monoclonal antibodies, are not rigid entities. Rather, they are characterised by their flexibility, which is the result of the interaction and collective motion of their constituent atoms. This conformational diversity has a significant impact on their physicochemical and biological properties. Among these are their structural stability, the transport of ions through the M2 channel, drug resistance, macromolecular docking, binding energy, and rational epitope design. To assess these properties and to calculate the associated thermodynamical observables, the conformational space must be efficiently sampled and the dynamic of the constituent atoms must be simulated. This paper presents algorithms and techniques that address the abovementioned issues. To this end, a computational review of molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, Langevin dynamics, and free energy calculation is presented. The exposition is made from first principles to promote a better understanding of the potentialities, limitations, applications, and interrelations of these computational methods.},

	abstract = {The point dipole interaction model for molecular polarizability recently proposed by Applequist, Carl, and Fung is modified by replacing the point dipole interaction by an interaction between smeared out dipoles. Rules are developed to indicate plausible forms for this modified interaction. The polarizabilities of a wide range of chemically different molecules can be calculated, using for each atom one polarizability independent of its chemical enviromnent. The errors are comparable to experimental uncertainty. Special care is taken to produce a model that tends to avoid infinite polarizabilities without use of cutoffs at short distances.},

	abstract = {The vibrational energy relaxation paths of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) OH excited in pure water and in isotopically diluted (deuterated) water are elucidated via non-equilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics (NE-AIMD) simulations. The present study extends the previous NE-AIMD simulation for the energy relaxation of an excited free OH vibration at an air/water interface [T. Ishiyama, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 104708 (2021)] to the energy relaxation of an excited H-bonded OH vibration in bulk water. The present simulation shows that the excited OH vibration in pure water dissipates its energy on a timescale of 0.1 ps, whereas that in deuterated water relaxes on a timescale of 0.7 ps, consistent with the experimental observations. To decompose these relaxation energies into the components due to intramolecular and intermolecular couplings, constraints are introduced on the vibrational modes except for the target path in the NE-AIMD simulation. In the case of pure water, 80\% of the total relaxation is attributed to the pathway due to the resonant intermolecular OH⋯OH stretch coupling, and the remaining 17\% and 3\% are attributed to intramolecular couplings with the bend overtone and with the conjugate OH stretch, respectively. This result strongly supports a significant role for the Förster transfer mechanism of pure water due to the intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions. In the case of deuterated water, on the other hand, 36\% of the total relaxation is due to the intermolecular stretch coupling, and all the remaining 64\% arises from coupling with the intramolecular bend overtone.},
