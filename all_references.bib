To enhance their physical stabilities near ambient conditions, the most stable clathrate hydrates should be identified. Here we report the lowest-energy networks of the tetrakaidecahedral cage (T-cage) (H2O)24 cluster, a constituent of the unit cell of the structure I [denoted (sI)] hydrate. A four-step screening method was employed to search for the lowest-energy T-cage networks, which were eventually optimized at the MP2 level of theory. We further outline a procedure based on the obtained low-energy isomers of the T-cage for constructing periodic unit cells of the (sI) hydrate lattice.},

	abstract = {The reactive force-field (ReaxFF) interatomic potential is a powerful computational tool for exploring, developing and optimizing material properties. Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics (QM), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require significantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predefined connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The ReaxFF method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, ReaxFF casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive QM calculations. This article provides an overview of the development, application, and future directions of the ReaxFF method.},

	abstract = {We present a protocol for classical and nuclear quantum dynamics, in which the energies and forces are generated by the many-body expansion (MBE), and apply it to water clusters using the TTM2.1-F and MB-Pol interaction potentials at various temperatures. We carry out MBE-molecular dynamics (MD) classical and nuclear quantum dynamical simulations, in which the energies and forces of the full system are approximated by the two-, three-, and four-body terms of the MBE, and compare the average potential and the vibrational density of states with the full simulation, i.e., the one for which no MBE is used. Our results indicate that the thermally averaged potential energy from the MBE up to the four-body term converges with near-identical behavior to the one from the full simulation. The three-body makes a substantial contribution (∼20\%) to the energy, whereas the four-body is necessary for obtaining quantitatively accurate energetics and forces, albeit making a small contribution to each (∼2\%). We further show that the harmonic frequencies are reproduced to within a few wavenumbers (cm–1) at the four-body level and that the slowest modes to converge with the MBE rank are those involving the strongest hydrogen bonds. Anharmonicity exacerbates this effect, so that a four-body description of the energies and forces is needed to achieve accurate anharmonic vibrational frequencies in the hydrogen-bonded OH-stretching region. We also discuss the asymptotic scaling of the MBE-MD protocol with respect to the cost of the underlying potential energy evaluation, suggesting that electronic structure methods that scale at least as N4, N being the size of the system, are needed to result in savings over the traditional full MD simulation. We anticipate that the MBE-MD protocol can evolve into a powerful and practical method, which will allow for highly accurate ab initio MD simulations on a much broader range of molecular systems than can be currently handled.},

These gas-to-water transfer free energies have in the past proven a valuable test of a variety of computational methods and force fields. Here, in contrast to some previous SAMPL challenges, we find a relatively wide range of methods perform quite well on this test set, with RMS errors in the 1.2 kcal/mol range for several of the best performing methods. Top-performers included a quantum mechanical approach with continuum solvent models and functional group corrections, alchemical molecular dynamics simulations with a classical all-atom force field, and a single-confor-mation Poisson-Boltzmann approach. While 1.2 kcal/mol is still a significant error, experimental hydration free energies covered a range of nearly 20 kcal/mol, so methods typically showed substantial predictive power. Here, a substantial new focus was on evaluation of error estimates, as predicting when a computational prediction is reliable vs. unreliable has considerable practical value. We found, however, that in many cases errors are substantially underestimated, and that typically little effort has been invested in estimating likely error. We believe this is an important area for further research.},

We present TeraChem Cloud, a high-performance computing service (HPCS) that offers on-demand electronic structure calculations on both traditional HPC clusters and cloud-based hardware. The framework is designed using off-the-shelf web technologies and containerization to be extremely scalable and portable. Within the HPCS model, users can quickly develop new methods and algorithms in an interactive environment on their laptop while allowing TeraChem Cloud to distribute ab initio calculations across all available resources. This approach greatly increases the accessibility of hardware accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and flexibility for the development of new methods as additional electronic structure packages are integrated into the framework as alternative backends. Cost-performance analysis indicates that traditional nodes are the most cost-effective long-term solution, but commercial cloud providers offer cutting-edge hardware with competitive rates for short-term large-scale calculations. We demonstrate the power of the TeraChem Cloud framework by carrying out several showcase calculations, including the generation of 300,000 density functional theory energy and gradient evaluations on medium-sized organic molecules and reproducing 300 fs of nonadiabatic dynamics on the B800-B850 antenna complex in LH2, with the latter demonstration using over 50 Tesla V100 GPUs in a commercial cloud environment in 8 h for approximately \$1250.},

	abstract = {The interacting quantum atoms approach [IQA, as presented by Blanco et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 1, 1096 (2005)] is applied to standard hydrogen bonded dimers. IQA is an interpretation tool based on a real space energy decomposition scheme fully consistent with the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. It provides a partition of every physical term present in the Hamiltonian into atomic and interatomic contributions. The procedure is orbital-free and self-contained, needing neither external references nor artificial intermediate states. Binding is the result of a competition between the destabilizing deformations suffered by the interacting fragments upon interaction and the stabilizing interaction energy itself. According to IQA, there is no incompatibility between the prevalent electrostatic image of hydrogen bonded systems and that favoring important covalent contributions. Depending on how we gather the different energetic terms, we may recover electrostatic or covalent pictures from the same underlying quantum mechanical description. Our results show that the nonclassical contributions to hydrogen bonding are spatially localized, involving only the H atom and its two nearest neighbors. IQA is well suited as a comparative tool. Its thin energetic decomposition allows us to recover exactly (or to a very good approximation) the quantities of the most widely used energy decomposition schemes. Such a comparison sheds light on the virtues and faults of the different methods and on the origin of the

	abstract = {We present an empirical flexible and polarizable water model which gives an improved description of the position, momentum, and dynamical (spectroscopic) distributions of H nuclei in water. We use path integral molecular dynamics techniques in order to obtain momentum and position distributions and an approximate solution to the Schrödinger equation to obtain the infrared (IR) spectrum. We show that when the calculated distributions are compared to experiment the existing empirical models tend to overestimate the stiffness of the H nuclei involved in H bonds. Also, these models vastly underestimate the enormous increase in the integrated IR intensity observed in the bulk over the gas-phase value. We demonstrate that the over-rigidity of the OH stretch and the underestimation of intensity are connected to the failure of existing models to reproduce the correct monomer polarizability surface. A new model, TTM4-F, is parametrized against electronic structure results in order to better reproduce the polarizability surface. It is found that TTM4-F gives a superior description of the observed spectroscopy, showing both the correct redshift and a much improved intensity. TTM4-F also has a somewhat improved dielectric constant and OH distribution function. It also gives an improved match to the experimental momentum distribution, although some discrepancies remain.},

	abstract = {Quantum chemistry in the form of density functional theory (DFT) calculations is a powerful numerical experiment for predicting intermolecular interaction energies. However no chemical insight is gained in this way beyond predictions of observables. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) can quantitatively bridge this gap by providing values for the chemical drivers of the interactions, such as permanent electrostatics, Pauli repulsion, dispersion, and charge transfer. These energetic contributions are identiﬁed by performing DFT calculations with constraints that disable components of the interaction. The second generation version of the absolutely localized molecular orbital EDA (ALMOEDA-II) is described. The eﬀect of diﬀerent physical contributions on changes in observables such as structure, vibrational frequencies etc, upon complex formation is achieved via the adiabatic EDA. Several example applications are described: red versus blue-shifting hydrogen bonds, the bonding and frequency shifts of CO, N2, and BF bound to a [Ru(II)(NH3)5]2+ moiety, and the nature of the strongly bound complexes between pyridine and the benzene and naphthalene radical cations. Additionally, the use of ALMO-EDA-II to benchmark and assist in the development of advanced force ﬁelds for molecular simulation is illustrated with the recent, very promising, MB-UCB potential.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are well established for the study of biomolecular systems. Within these simulations, energy functions known as force fields are used to determine the forces acting on atoms and molecules. While these force fields have been very successful, they contain a number of approximations, included to overcome limitations in computing power. One of the most important of these approximations is the omission of polarizability, the process by which the charge distribution in a molecule changes in response to its environment. Since polarizability is known to be important in many biochemical situations, and since advances in computer hardware have reduced the need for approximations within force fields, there is major interest in the use of force fields that include an explicit representation of polarizability. As such, a number of polarizable force fields have been under development: these have been largely experimental, and their use restricted to specialized researchers. This situation is now changing. Parameters for fully optimized polarizable force fields are being published, and associated code incorporated into standard simulation software. Simulations on the hundred-nanosecond timescale are being reported, and are now within reach of all simulation scientists. In this overview, I examine the polarizable force fields available for the simulation of biomolecules, the systems to which they have been applied, and the benefits and challenges that polarizability can bring. In considering future directions for development of polarizable force fields, I examine lessons learnt from non-polarizable force fields, and highlight issues that remain to be addressed.

Here, we present MB-Fit, a software infrastructure for the automated development of MB-PEFs for generic molecules within the TTM-nrg (Thole-type model energy) and MB-nrg (many-body energy) theoretical frameworks. Besides providing all the necessary computational tools for generating TTM-nrg and MB-nrg PEFs, MB-Fit provides a seamless interface with the MBX software, a many-body energy and force calculator for computer simulations. Given the demonstrated accuracy of the MB-PEFs, particularly within the MB-nrg framework, we believe that MB-Fit will enable routine predictive computer simulations of generic (small) molecules in the gas, liquid, and solid phases, including, but not limited to, the modeling of quantum isomeric equilibria in molecular clusters, solvation processes, molecular crystals, and phase diagrams.},

	abstract = {Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful technique to probe the structure and dynamics of water. However, deriving an unambiguous molecular-level interpretation of the experimental spectral features remains a challenge due to the complexity of the underlying hydrogen-bonding network. In this contribution, we present an integrated theoretical and computational framework (named many-body molecular dynamics or MB-MD) that, by systematically removing uncertainties associated with existing approaches, enables a rigorous modeling of vibrational spectra of water from quantum dynamical simulations. Specifically, we extend approaches used to model the many-body expansion of interaction energies to develop many-body representations of the dipole moment and polarizability of water. The combination of these “first-principles” representations with centroid molecular dynamics simulations enables the simulation of infrared and Raman spectra of liquid water under ambient conditions that, without relying on any ad hoc parameters, are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results. Importantly, since the many-body energy, dipole, and polarizability surfaces employed in the simulations are derived independently from accurate fits to correlated electronic structure data, MB-MD allows for a systematic analysis of the calculated spectra in terms of both electronic and dynamical contributions. The present analysis suggests that, while MB-MD correctly reproduces both the shifts and the shapes of the main spectroscopic features, an improved description of quantum dynamical effects possibly combined with a dissociable water potential may be necessary for a quantitative representation of the OH stretch band.},

In this study, the accuracy of MB-pol is systematically assessed across the three phases of water through extensive comparisons with experimental data and high-level ab initio calculations. Individual many-body contributions to the interaction energies as well as vibrational spectra of water clusters calculated with MB-pol are in excellent agreement with reference data obtained at the coupled cluster level. Several structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties of the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure are investigated through classical molecular dynamics simulations as a function of temperature. The structural properties of the liquid phase are in nearly quantitative agreement with X-ray diffraction data available over the temperature range from 268 to 368 K. The analysis of other thermodynamic and dynamical quantities emphasizes the importance of explicitly including nuclear quantum effects in the simulations, especially at low temperature, for a physically correct description of the properties of liquid water. Furthermore, both densities and lattice energies of several ice phases are also correctly reproduced by MB-pol. Following a recent study of DFT models for water, a score is assigned to each computed property, which demonstrates the high and, in many respects, unprecedented accuracy of MB-pol in representing all three phases of water.},

Interestingly, the ground states of all clusters considered in this study, except for the dimer, are delocalized over at least two conformations that differ by the orientation of one or more water monomers with the relative isomer populations being sensitive to the isotope substitution. Most remarkably, the ground state of the (H2O)6 hexamer is represented by four distinct cage structures, while that of (D2O)6 is dominated by the prism, i.e., the global minimum geometry, with a very small contribution from a prism-book geometry. In addition, for (H2O)6 and (D2O)6, we performed DMC calculations to compute the ground states constrained to the cage and prism geometries. These calculations compared results for three different potentials, MB-pol, TTM3/F, and q-TIP4P/F.},

	abstract = {Classical potentials based on isotropic and additive atomic charges have been widely used to model molecules in computers for the past few decades. The crude approximations in the underlying physics are hindering both their accuracy and transferability across chemical and physical environments. Here we present a new classical potential, AMOEBA+, to capture essential intermolecular forces, including permanent electrostatics, repulsion, dispersion, many-body polarization, short-range charge penetration, and charge transfer, by extending the polarizable multipole-based AMOEBA (Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications) model. For a set of common organic molecules, we show that AMOEBA+ with general parameters can reproduce both quantum mechanical interactions and energy decompositions according to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). Additionally, a new water model based on the AMOEBA+ framework captures various liquid-phase properties in molecular dynamics simulations while remaining consistent with SAPT energy decompositions, utilizing both ab initio data and experimental liquid properties. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to improve the physical basis of classical force ﬁelds to advance their accuracy and general applicability.},

However, the calculation of charge-transfer energy is not an easy task. It is not a physically well-deﬁned term, and the results might depend on how it is described in practice. Commonly, the charge transfer is deﬁned in terms of molecular orbitals; in this framework, however, the charge transfer vanishes as the basis set size increases toward the complete basis set limit. This can be avoided by deﬁning the charge transfer in terms of the spatial extent of the electron densities of the interacting molecules, but the schemes used so far do not reﬂect the actual electronic structure of each particular system and thus are not reliable. We propose a spatial partitioning of the system, which is based on a charge transfer-free reference state, namely superimposition of electron densities of the noninteracting fragments. We show that this method, employing constrained DFT for the calculation of the charge-transfer energy, yields reliable results and is robust with respect to the strength of the charge transfer, the basis set size, and the DFT functional used. Because it is based on DFT, the method is applicable to rather large systems.},

The current version (AMOEBA2013) utilizes permanent electrostatic multipole moments through the quadrupole at each atom, and explicitly treats polarization eﬀects in various chemical and physical environments. The atomic multipole electrostatic parameters for each amino acid residue type are derived from high-level gas phase quantum mechanical calculations via a consistent and extensible protocol. Molecular polarizability is modeled via a Thole-style damped interactive induction model based upon distributed atomic polarizabilities. Inter- and intramolecular polarization is treated in a consistent fashion via the Thole model. The intramolecular polarization model ensures transferability of electrostatic parameters among diﬀerent conformations, as demonstrated by the agreement between QM and AMOEBA electrostatic potentials, and dipole moments of dipeptides. The backbone and side chain torsional parameters were determined by comparing to gas-phase QM (RI-TRIM MP2/CBS) conformational energies of dipeptides and to statistical distributions from the Protein Data Bank. Molecular dynamics simulations are reported for short peptides in explicit water to examine their conformational properties in solution. Overall the calculated conformational free energies and J-coupling constants are consistent with PDB statistics and experimental NMR results, respectively. In addition, the experimental crystal structures of a number of proteins are well maintained during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. While further calculations are necessary to fully validate the force ﬁeld, initial results suggest the AMOEBA polarizable multipole force ﬁeld is able to describe the structure and energetics of peptides and proteins, in both gasphase and solution environments.},

Using the density-fitting approach, the nonadditive dispersion energy can be obtained with O(N(5)) scaling with respect to the system size, the best scaling among all available methods of evaluating this quantity. Numerical results are reported for the helium, argon, water, and benzene trimers. The nonadditive energy computed for these systems is in a good agreement with benchmarks. Some hybrid perturbational-supermolecular approaches are proposed that can provide--with only O(N(5)) scaling--nonadditive energies with accuracy comparable to more expensive supermolecular methods, such as the third-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory. Such approaches can be used for studying nonadditive effects in systems larger than it is currently possible with supermolecular methods at a level high enough to capture all essential components of the three-body interaction energy.},

	abstract = {Pauli repulsion is a key component of any theory of intermolecular interactions. Although Pauli or exchange repulsion has its origin in the quantum mechanical nature of electrons, it is possible to describe the resulting energetic effects via a classical model in terms of the overlap of electron densities. In fact, closed shell intermolecular repulsion can be explained as a diminution of election density in the internuclear region resulting in decreased screening of nuclear charges and increased nuclear-nuclear repulsion. We provide a concise anisotropic repulsion formulation using the atomic multipoles from the Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications force field to describe the electron density at each atom in a larger system. Mathematically, the proposed model consists of damped pairwise exponential multipolar repulsion interactions truncated at short range, which are suitable for use in compute-intensive biomolecular force fields and molecular dynamics simulations. Parameters for 26 atom classes encompassing most organic molecules are derived from a fit to Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory exchange repulsion energies for the S101 dimer database. Several applications of the multipolar Pauli repulsion model are discussed, including noble gas interactions, analysis of stationary points on the water dimer potential surface, and the directionality of several halogen bonding interactions.},

	abstract = {New developments of the adjustable density matrix assembler (ADMA) approach to macromolecular quantum chemistry are described, based on the original fuzzy density matrix fragmentation scheme combined with an approach of using point charges to approximate the effects of additional, distant parts of a given macromolecule in the quantum chemical calculation of each fragment. The ADMA approach divides a macromolecule (the target molecule) into fuzzy fragments, for which conventional quantum chemical calculations are performed using moderate-sized “parent molecules” which contain both the fragment and all the local interactions of the fuzzy fragment with its surroundings within a preselected distance. For any such distance criterion, that is, for any size limit for the parent molecules, the computational time scales linearly with the size of the macromolecule. As demonstrated in earlier papers, in the original, linear-scaling ADMA approach, the accuracy is fully controlled by this distance, and with a large enough distance criterion nearly exact results are obtained when compared with the conventional Hartree−Fock method. In the new field-adapted ADMA method the same accuracy can be achieved using a smaller distance criterion for the parent molecules if in each parent molecule calculation point charges are also used to represent distant parts of the macromolecule. This allows one to use smaller parent molecules and faster overall calculations resulting in the same overall accuracy that can be achieved only with larger parent molecules in the original ADMA method. Specifically, in the quantum chemical calculations determining the fragment density matrices, each parent molecule is placed within a point-charge field representing the rest of the macromolecule. Consequently, not only the short-range interactions within the actual parent molecule, but also the approximate effects of longer-range electrostatic interactions present in the rest of the macromolecule, are included in the new fragment density matrices. With a number of test calculations of small oligopeptides and proteins, it is shown that the inclusion of partial charges is an efficient tool to obtain results of a uniform accuracy for all these test cases, and that this approach can be used to reduce the need to include longer-range interactions by explicit quantum chemical calculation for much larger parent molecules for the fragments. With a large increase in accuracy and the decrease in computational demand, the field-adapted ADMA approach is now able to describe efficiently very large biomolecular systems at the ab initio quality level.},

	abstract = {Recently, a new type of generalized symmetry of ice structures was introduced which takes into account the change of direction of all hydrogen bonds. The energy nonequivalence of pairs of configurations with opposite direction of all hydrogen bonds was established in the course of computer simulation of bilayer ice and other four-coordinated structures without `dangling' hydrogen atoms. In this article, the results of detailed investigations of the violation of the hydrogen-bond-reversal symmetry in ice nanotubes consisting of stacked n-membered rings are presented. A comprehensive classification of all possible hydrogen-bonding configurations and their division into two classes (antisymmetrical and non-antisymmetrical) are given. Attention is focused on the most stable configurations that have no longitudinally arranged water molecules. This restriction made the asymmetry very difficult to find. For example, it was established that the asymmetry (non-antisymmetrical configurations) in ice nanotubes with square, pentagonal and hexagonal cross sections appears only when the number of transverse rings in the unit cell is more than six. It is shown that this is related to the well known combinatorial problem of enumerating the symmetry-distinct necklaces of black and white beads. It was found that, among the ice nanotubes that had been considered, hydrogen-bond-reversal asymmetry is most conspicuous in wide nanotubes such as heptagonal and octagonal. In this case the asymmetry is observed for unit cells of any length. In order to verify the results of the symmetry analysis and to confirm the energy nonequivalence of some (non-antisymmetrical) configurations, approximate calculations of the binding energy have been performed using the package TINKER.},

The errors are comparable to experimental uncertainty. Special care is taken to produce a model that tends to avoid infinite polarizabilities without use of cutoffs at short distances.},

	abstract = {Fragmentation methods have been widely studied for computing quantum mechanical (QM) energy of medium-sized water clusters, but less attention has been paid to large-sized ion–water clusters, in which many-body QM interaction is more significant, because of the charge-transfer effect between ions and water molecules. In this study, we utilized electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation (EE-GMF) method for full QM calculation of the large-sized ion–water clusters (up to 15 Na+ and 15 Cl– ions solvated with 119 water molecules). Through systematic validation using different fragment sizes, we show that, by using distance thresholds of 6 Å for both the two-body and three-body QM interactions, the EE-GMF method is capable of providing accurate ground-state energies of large-sized ion–water clusters at different ab initio levels (including HF, B3LYP, M06-2X, and MP2) with significantly reduced computational cost. The deviations of EE-GMF from full system calculations are within a few kcal/mol. The result clearly shows that the calculated energies of the ion–water clusters using EE-GMF are close to converge after the distance thresholds are larger than 6 Å for both the two-body and three-body QM interactions. This study underscores the importance of the three-body interactions in ion–water clusters. The EE-GMF method can also accurately reproduce the relative energy profiles of the ion–water clusters.},

In this GMFCC/MM scheme, the interaction energy between neighboring residues as well as between non-neighboring residues that are spatially in close contact are computed by quantum mechanics while the rest of the interaction energy is computed by molecular mechanics. Numerical studies are carried out to calculate torsional energies of six polypeptides using the GMFCC/MM approach and the energies are shown to be in general good agreement with the full system quantum calculation. Among those we tested is a polypeptide containing 396 atoms whose energies are computed at the 
MP2∕6-31

 level. Our study shows that using GMFCC/MM, it is possible to perform high level ab initio calculation such as MP2 for applications such as structural optimization of protein complex and molecular dynamics simulation.},

It has become possible to carry out accurate calculations of intermolecular forces for molecules of useful size, and to apply the results to important practical applications such as understanding protein structure and function, and predicting the structures of molecular crystals. The Theory of Intermolecular Forces sets out the mathematical techniques that are needed to describe and calculate intermolecular interactions and to handle the more elaborate mathematical models. It describes the methods that are used to calculate them, including recent developments in the use of density functional theory and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. The use of higher-rank multipole moments to describe electrostatic interactions is explained in both Cartesian and spherical tensor formalism, and methods that avoid the multipole expansion are also discussed. Modern ab initio perturbation theory methods for the calculation of intermolecular interactions are discussed in detail, and methods for calculating properties of molecular clusters and condensed matter for comparison with experiment are surveyed.},

Starting with reported nonbonded parameters of alcohols, ethers, and diols, torsional parameters were fit to reproduce results from ab initio calculations on the hexopyranoses, α,β-d-glucopyranose, α,β-d-mannopyranose, α,β-d-galactopyranose, methyl α,β-d-glucopyranoside, and methyl α,β-d-mannopyranoside. In all, geometry optimizations were carried out for 144 conformers at the restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF)/6–31G* level. For the conformers with a relative energy within 3 kcal/mol of the global minima, the effects of electron correlation and basis-set extension were considered by performing single-point calculations with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6–311+G** level. The torsional parameters for the OPLS-AA force field were parameterized to reproduce the energies and structures of these 44 conformers. The resultant force field reproduces the ab initio calculated energies with an average unsigned error of 0.41 kcal/mol. The α/β ratios as well as the relative energies between the isomeric hexopyranoses are in good accord with the ab initio results. The predictive abilities of the force field were also tested against RHF/6–31G* results for d-allopyranose with excellent success; a surprising discovery is that the lowest energy conformer of d-allopyranose is a β anomer. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {The deviations from the equation of state for perfect gases which are observed in all known gases result from the interactions of their constituent atoms or molecules. The excess pressures observed at all but the lowest temperatures show that the dominating factor is the strong repulsion between atoms at close renge, due to the interpentration of complete electron shells. Little is known about these repulsions, and that is readily summarized. Between atoms with spherically symmetrical distributions it is likely that the repulsive potential is accurately represented by a function P(r)e-r/p, (1) Where r is separation of the atomic nuclei and P(r) a polynomial in r. Quantum theoretical calculations made by Slater (1928) for helium atoms (with a closed shell of two electrons) and by Bleick and Mayer (1934) for neon atoms (with a closed shell of eight electrons) show that an adequate expression may sometimes be obtained if the polynomial is replaced by a constant. Some confirmation of this (though over a very restricted range of r) is given by Born and Mayer (1932) and Huggins (1937), whose work on ionic cubic crystals shows that their elastic properties are admirably correlated when the repulsive potential of two ions of rare gas type is represented by an exponential function be-r/p, with a range of about one atomic diameter.},

The empirical law relating the normal molecular separation r0 and the classical vibration frequency ω0 is shown to be r03ω0=K to within a probable error of 4 percent, where K is the same constant for all diatomic molecules and for all electronic levels. By means of this law, and by means of the solution above, the experimental data for many of the electronic levels of various molecules are analyzed and a table of constants is obtained from which the potential energy curves can be plotted.

This is the result of two advances reported in 1989:  an accurate method for solving the electronic Schrödinger equation that is applicable to a broad range of moleculesthe CCSD(T) methodand families of basis sets that systematically converge to the complete basis set limitthe correlation consistent basis sets. The former provides unprecedented accuracy for the prediction of a broad range of molecular properties, including molecular binding energies. The latter provides a means to systematically approach the complete basis set limit, i.e., the exact solutions of approximations to the Schrödinger equation. These two advances combined with a thorough analysis of the errors involved in electronic structure calculations lead to clear guidelines for ab initio calculations of binding energies, ranging from the strong bonds derived from chemical interactions to the extremely weak binding due to dispersion interactions. This analysis has also led to surprises, e.g., it has shown that the Møller−Plesset perturbation theory is unsuitable for calculation of bond energies to chemical accuracy, i.e., with errors of less that 1 kcal/mol. This applies whether one is interested in absolute bond energies or relative bond energies. Although the analysis presented here is focused on the calculation of molecular binding energies, this same approach can be readily extended to other molecular properties.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in path integral methodology have significantly reduced the computational expense of including quantum mechanical effects in the nuclear motion in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. However, the implementation of these developments requires a considerable programming effort, which has hindered their adoption. Here we describe i-PI, an interface written in Python that has been designed to minimise the effort required to bring state-of-the-art path integral techniques to an electronic structure program. While it is best suited to first principles calculations and path integral molecular dynamics, i-PI can also be used to perform classical molecular dynamics simulations, and can just as easily be interfaced with an empirical forcefield code. To give just one example of the many potential applications of the interface, we use it in conjunction with the CP2K electronic structure package to showcase the importance of nuclear quantum effects in high-pressure water.

The observed structural alternation between interior (n=17, 19, 21) and all-surface (n=18, 20) global minima in the n=17–21 cluster regime is accompanied by a corresponding spectroscopic signature, namely, the undulation in the position of the most redshifted OH stretching vibrations according to the trend: interior configurations exhibit more redshifted OH stretching vibrations than all-surface ones. These most redshifted OH stretching vibrations form distinct groups in the intramolecular region of the spectra and correspond to localized vibrations of donor OH stretches that are connected to neighbors via “strong” (water dimer-like) hydrogen bonds and belong to a water molecule with a “free” OH stretch.},

Linear and nonlinear infrared (IR) spectra are calculated for liquid water, HOD in D2O and HOD in H2O, and discussed in the context of the results obtained using other approaches that have been employed in studies of water dynamics. A comparison between the calculated spectra and the available experimental data yields an overall good agreement, indicating the accuracy of the present simulation approach in describing the properties of liquid water under ambient conditions.

Configurations in which the water molecules act as proton donor-acceptors, double acceptors and double donors were considered. The energy separation between the ‘cyclic’ and ‘open’ water trimer minima was estimated at 4·2 kcal mot −1. Its origin was quantitatively accounted for in terms of the difference between the two- and three-body energy terms for the two configurations. We have found that the three-body term is attractive and accounts for 18\% of the binding energy of the ‘cyclic’ trimer but its contribution is less significant (6\%) and repulsive for the ‘open’ trimer. It is also repulsive but smaller (4\%) for an intermediate trimer configuration which has the arrangement double acceptor, double donor, donor-acceptor for the three water molecules. Many-body energy terms higher than two are, however, less significant for configurations resembling bulk water which have, on the average, two hydrogen bonds per water molecule. The MP4 results were found to differ only slightly (less than 2\%) from the corresponding MP2 results.},

	abstract = {We report an ab initio, full-dimensional, potential energy surface (PES) for CO2—H2O, in which two-body interaction energies are fit using a basis of permutationally invariant polynomials and combined with accurate potentials for the non-interacting monomers. This approach which we have termed “plug and play” is extended here to improve the precision of the 2-body fit in the long range. This is done by combining two separate fits. One is a fit to 47 593 2-body energies in the region of strong interaction and approaching the long range, and the second one is a fit to 6244 2-body energies in the long range. The two fits have a region of overlap which permits a smooth switch from one to the other. All energies are obtained at the CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Properties of the full PES, i.e., stationary points, harmonic frequencies of the global minimum, etc., are shown to be in excellent agreement with direct CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ results. Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the dimer zero-point energy (ZPE) are performed, and a dissociation energy, D0, of 787 cm−1 is obtained using that ZPE, De, and the rigorous ZPEs of the monomers. Using a benchmark De, D0 is 758 cm−1. Vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF)/virtual state configuration interaction (VCI) MULTIMODE calculations of intramolecular fundamentals are reported and are in good agreement with available experimental results. Finally, the full dimer PES is combined with an existing ab initio water potential to develop a potential for the CO2 hydrate clathrate CO2(H2O)20(512 water cage). A full normal-mode analysis of this hydrate clathrate is reported as are local-monomer VSCF/VCI calculations of the fundamentals of CO2.},

Two approaches, each able to ensure the asymptotic zero-interaction limit of intrinsic potentials, are presented. They are both based on the tailored selection of a subset of the polynomials of the original basis. A computationally efficient approach exploits reduced permutational invariance and provides a compact fitting basis dependent only on intermolecular distances. We apply the original and new techniques to obtain a number of full-dimensional potentials for the intrinsic three-body methane–water–water interaction by fitting a database made of 22,592 ab initio energies calculated at the MP2-F12 level of theory with haTZ (aug-cc-pVTZ for C and O, cc-pVTZ for H) basis set. An investigation of the effects of permutational symmetry on fitting accuracy and computational costs is reported. Several of the fitted potentials are then employed to evaluate with high accuracy the three-body contribution to the CH4–H2O–H2O binding energy and the three-body energy of three conformers of the CH4@(H2O)20 cluster.},

This approach is based on our previously proposed GMFCC/MM method (He; et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 124, 184703), In this EE-GMFCC scheme, the total energy of protein is calculated by taking a linear combination of the QM energy of the neighboring residues and the two-body QM interaction energy between non-neighboring residues that are spatially in close contact. All the fragment calculations are embedded in a field of point charges representing the remaining protein environment, which is the major improvement over our previous GMFCC/MM approach. Numerical studies are carried out to calculate the total energies of 18 real three-dimensional proteins of up to 1142 atoms using the EE-GMFCC approach at the HF/6-31G* level. The overall mean unsigned error of EE-GMFCC for the 18 proteins is 2.39 kcal/mol with reference to the full system HF/6-31G* energies. The EE-GMFCC approach is also applied for proteins at the levels of the density functional theory (DFT) and second-order many-body perturbation theory (MP2), also showing only a few kcal/mol deviation from the corresponding full system result. The EE-GMFCC method is linear-scaling with a low prefactor, trivially parallel, and can be readily applied to routinely perform structural optimization of proteins and molecular dynamics simulation with high level ab initio electronic structure theories.},

The method employs energy gradients extracted from fragment wave functions, enabling computations otherwise impractical on PC hardware.

	abstract = {ConspectusChemistry on the scale of molecular clusters may be dramatically different from that in the macroscopic bulk. Greater understanding of chemistry in this size regime could greatly influence fields such as materials science and atmospheric and environmental chemistry. Recent advances in experimental techniques and computational resources have led to accurate investigations of the energies and spectral properties of weakly bonded molecular clusters. These have enabled researchers to learn how the physicochemical properties evolve from individual molecules to bulk materials and to understand the growth patterns of clusters.Experimental techniques such as infrared, microwave, and photoelectron spectroscopy are the most popular and powerful tools for probing molecular clusters. In general, these experimental techniques do not directly reveal the atomistic details of the clusters but provide data from which the structural details need to be unearthed. Furthermore, the resolution of the spectral properties of energetically close cluster conformers can be prohibitively difficult. Thus, these investigations of molecular aggregates require a combination of experiments and theory. On the theoretical front, researchers have been actively engaged in quantum chemical ab initio calculations as well as simulation-based studies for the last few decades. To obtain reliable results, there is a need to use correlated methods such as Møller–Plesset second order method, coupled cluster theory, or dispersion corrected density functional theory. However, due to nonlinear scaling of these methods, optimizing the geometry of large clusters still remains a formidable quantum chemistry challenge.Fragment-based methods, such as divide-and-conquer, molecular tailoring approach (MTA), fragment molecular orbitals, and generalized energy-based fragmentation approach, provide alternatives for overcoming the scaling problem for spatially extended molecular systems. Within MTA, a large system is broken down into two or more subsystems that can be readily treated computationally. Finally, the properties of the large system are obtained by patching the corresponding properties of all the subsystems. Due to these approximations, the resulting MTA-based energies carry some error in comparison with calculations based on the full system. An approach for correcting these errors has been attempted by grafting the error at a lower basis set onto a higher basis set. Furthermore, investigating the growth patterns and nucleation processes in clusters is necessary for understanding the structural transitions and the phenomena of magic numbers in cluster chemistry. Therefore, systematic building-up or the introduction of stochastics for generating molecular assemblies is the most crucial step for studying large clusters.In this Account, we discuss the working principle of MTA for probing molecular clusters at ab initio level followed by a brief summary of an automated and electrostatics-guided algorithm for building molecular assemblies. The molecular aggregates presented here as test cases are generated based on either an electrostatic criterion or the basin hopping method. At MP2 level computation, the errors in MTA-based grafted energies are typically reduced to a submillihartree level, reflecting the potential of finding accurate energies of molecular clusters much more quickly. In summary, MTA provides a platform for effectively studying large molecular clusters at ab initio level of theory using minimal computer hardware.},

The method, which does not involve a supercell, affords accurate efficient simulations of neutral or charged finite systems which possess, or may develop, multipole moments. Since the ground-state electronic energy and the forces on the ions are calculated for each nuclear configuration during a dynammical simulation, a relatively large time step can be used to integrate the classical equations of motion of the nuclei (1–10 fs, depending on the characteristic frequencies of the ionic degrees of freedom). The method is demonstrated via a study of the energetics, structure, and dynamics of the water dimer, (H2O)2, yielding results in agreement with experimental data and other theoretical calculations. In addition to the properties of the ground state of the dimer, higher-energy transition structures involved in transformations between equivalent structures of the (H2O)2 molecule, were studied, and finite temperature simulations of the dynamics of such transformations are presented.},

This algorithm has achieved unprecedented precision in the description of one-dimensional quantum systems. It has therefore quickly become the method of choice for numerical studies of such systems. Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic, and thermodynamic quantities in these systems are reviewed here. The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is also discussed. This review additionally considers the theoretical foundations of the method, examining its relationship to matrix-product states and the quantum information content of the density matrices generated by the DMRG.},

	abstract = {Macromolecular structures, such as neuraminidases, hemagglutinins, and monoclonal antibodies, are not rigid entities. Rather, they are characterised by their flexibility, which is the result of the interaction and collective motion of their constituent atoms. This conformational diversity has a significant impact on their physicochemical and biological properties. Among these are their structural stability, the transport of ions through the M2 channel, drug resistance, macromolecular docking, binding energy, and rational epitope design. To assess these properties and to calculate the associated thermodynamical observables, the conformational space must be efficiently sampled and the dynamic of the constituent atoms must be simulated. This paper presents algorithms and techniques that address the abovementioned issues. To this end, a computational review of molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, Langevin dynamics, and free energy calculation is presented. The exposition is made from first principles to promote a better understanding of the potentialities, limitations, applications, and interrelations of these computational methods.},

	abstract = {The vibrational energy relaxation paths of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) OH excited in pure water and in isotopically diluted (deuterated) water are elucidated via non-equilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics (NE-AIMD) simulations. The present study extends the previous NE-AIMD simulation for the energy relaxation of an excited free OH vibration at an air/water interface [T. Ishiyama, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 104708 (2021)] to the energy relaxation of an excited H-bonded OH vibration in bulk water. The present simulation shows that the excited OH vibration in pure water dissipates its energy on a timescale of 0.1 ps, whereas that in deuterated water relaxes on a timescale of 0.7 ps, consistent with the experimental observations. To decompose these relaxation energies into the components due to intramolecular and intermolecular couplings, constraints are introduced on the vibrational modes except for the target path in the NE-AIMD simulation. In the case of pure water, 80\% of the total relaxation is attributed to the pathway due to the resonant intermolecular OH⋯OH stretch coupling, and the remaining 17\% and 3\% are attributed to intramolecular couplings with the bend overtone and with the conjugate OH stretch, respectively. This result strongly supports a significant role for the Förster transfer mechanism of pure water due to the intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions. In the case of deuterated water, on the other hand, 36\% of the total relaxation is due to the intermolecular stretch coupling, and all the remaining 64\% arises from coupling with the intramolecular bend overtone.},
