\caption[Contribution of the correlation energy to the various many-body terms for \ce{(H2O)n}, n = 7, 10, 13, 16. The results are obtained with the largest basis set used for each isomer (see text). The percentage of the total correlation energy is given in parentheses. Energies are in kcal/mol, while parentheses indicate the percentage of the total correlation energy.]{Contribution of the correlation energy to the various many-body terms for \ce{(H2O)n}, n = 7, 10, 13, 16.
