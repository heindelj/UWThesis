Note the magnification (10 – 1000X) of the y-axis in the middle and right panels used to indicate the small magnitude of the higher-order relative to the ones for the 2- and 3-body terms.]{Magnitude of the uncorrected (top) and BSSE-corrected (bottom) 1- through 10-body MBE terms for the \ce{(H2O)_{10}} cluster.
