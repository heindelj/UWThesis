\caption[Examples of a stable \ce{(H2O)_{20}} clathrate cage (left) and one of the most common defects, which occurs when a candidate clathrate structure collapses to a different hydrogen bonding arrangement. The arrows show that a free OH bridges one of the 5-membered rings in \ce{(H2O)_{20}}, resulting in fused 3- and 4-membered rings.]{Examples of a stable \ce{(H2O)_{20}} clathrate cage (left) and one of the most common defects, which occurs when a candidate clathrate structure collapses to a different hydrogen bonding arrangement.
