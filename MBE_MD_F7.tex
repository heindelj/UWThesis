The \ce{(H2O)_{10}} cluster of interest was re-optimized using the MBE and harmonic frequencies were calculated at each minimum using the $k$-body potential. The x-axis simply labels the mode number starting from the lowest frequency harmonic vibration and the y-axis shows deviation from the full harmonic frequencies. The dashed lines separate low-frequency librational modes from HOH bends and OH stretches. The 4-body representation has a maximum deviation of less than 5 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ in the OH stretches.}\label{fig:MBE_MD_F7}
