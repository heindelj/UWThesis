\caption[Vibrational density of states as calculated from a 2-, 3-, and 4-body representation of the forces at temperatures of 50K, 100K, 150K, and 200K. The VDOS calculated from the full system is also shown for comparison. Note that each panel has a different y-axis because thermal broadening results in significantly decreased maximum intensity.]{Vibrational density of states as calculated from a 2-, 3-, and 4-body representation of the forces at temperatures of 50K, 100K, 150K, and 200K.
